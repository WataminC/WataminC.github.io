# Isomorphisms

## Definition

Two group $(G, \cdot)$ and $(H, \odot)$ are isomorphic if there exists a one-to-ont(injective) and onto(surjective) map $\phi : G \rightarrow H$, such that the group operation is preserved; that is,

$$\phi(a \cdot b) = \phi(a) \odot \phi(b)$$

for all a and b in $G$. If $G$ is isomorphic to $H$, we write $G \cong H$. The map $\phi$ is called an isomorphism.


### Example

- $Z_4 \cong \langle i \rangle$
- $Z_8^* \cong Z_{12}^*$

### Question

Do $Z_{61}^* \text{ isomorphic to } Z_{77}^*$? Why or why not?

## Theorem about Isomorphisms

### Proposition

Let $\phi : G \rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism of two groups, then the following statements are true.

- $\phi^{-1}: H \rightarrow G$ is an isomorphism
- $|G| = |H|$
- If $G$ is abelian, then $H$ is abelian
- If $G$ is cyclic, then $H$ is cyclic
- If $G$ has a subgroup of order n, then $H$ has a subgroup of order n

:::important Theorem
All cyclic groups of infinite order are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$

#### Proof:

Suppose $\mathbb{G}$ is a cyclic infinite order, and $g \in \mathbb{G}$ is a generator. Define $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{G}$ by $\phi(n) = g^n$. Then

$$\phi(m + n) = g^{m+n} = g^m g^n = \phi(m)\phi(n)$$

Next we need to show $\phi$ is a bijective map. The process is similar to the way proving Fermat's Little Theorem.

:::important Theorem

If $G$ is a cyclic group of order n, then $G$ is isomorphic to $Z_n$

#### Proof:

Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a cyclic group with order n, generated by g. Define $\phi: \mathbb{Z}_n \rightarrow \mathbb{G}$ by $\phi: k \rightarrow g_k$, where $0 \leq k < n$.

The process proving $\phi$ is a isomorphism is similar to the above way.

#### Corollary:

If $\mathbb{G}$ is a cyclic group of order p where p is a prime, then $\mathbb{G}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p$
