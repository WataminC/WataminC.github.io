# Isomorphisms

## Definition

Two group $(G, \cdot)$ and $(H, \odot)$ are isomorphic if there exists a one-to-ont(injective) and onto(surjective) map $\phi : G \rightarrow H$, such that the group operation is preserved; that is,

$$\phi(a \cdot b) = \phi(a) \odot \phi(b)$$

for all a and b in $G$. If $G$ is isomorphic to $H$, we write $G \cong H$. The map $\phi$ is called an isomorphism.


### Example

- $Z_4 \cong \langle i \rangle$
- $Z_8^* \cong Z_{12}^*$

### Question

Do $Z_{61}^* \text{ isomorphic to } Z_{77}^*$? Why or why not?

## Theorem about Isomorphisms

### Proposition

Let $\phi : G \rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism of two groups, then the following statements are true.

- $\phi^{-1}: H \rightarrow G$ is an isomorphism
- $|G| = |H|$
- If $G$ is abelian, then $H$ is abelian
- If $G$ is cyclic, then $H$ is cyclic
- If $G$ has a subgroup of order n, then $H$ has a subgroup of order n

:::important Theorem
All cyclic groups of infinite order are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$

#### Proof:

Suppose $\mathbb{G}$ is a cyclic infinite order, and $g \in \mathbb{G}$ is a generator. Define $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{G}$ by $\phi(n) = g^n$. Then

$$\phi(m + n) = g^{m+n} = g^m g^n = \phi(m)\phi(n)$$

Next we need to show $\phi$ is a bijective map. The process is similar to the way proving Fermat's Little Theorem.

:::important Theorem

If $G$ is a cyclic group of order n, then $G$ is isomorphic to $Z_n$

#### Proof:

Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a cyclic group with order n, generated by g. Define $\phi: \mathbb{Z}_n \rightarrow \mathbb{G}$ by $\phi: k \rightarrow g_k$, where $0 \leq k < n$.

The process proving $\phi$ is a isomorphism is similar to the above way.

#### Corollary:

If $\mathbb{G}$ is a cyclic group of order p where p is a prime, then $\mathbb{G}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p$

The isomorphism of groups determines equivalence relation of the class of all groups

(Cayley) Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations

# Homomorphisms

## Definition 

Two group $(\mathbb{G}, \cdot)$ and $(\mathbb{H}, \odot)$ are homomorphic if there exists a map $\phi: \mathbb{G} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}$ such  that the group operation is preserved; that is

$$\phi(a \cdot b) = \phi(a) \odot \phi(b)$$

for all a and b in $\mathbb{G}$. The map $\phi$ is called a homomorphism.

## Normal subgroups 

### Definition

A subgroup $\mathbb{H}$ of a group $\mathbb{G}$ is normal in $\mathbb{G}$ if $g\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{H}g$ for all $g \in \mathbb{G}$

:::tip Basic idea of normal subgroups
- A normal subgroup shows a kind of "communitive"
- A subgroup $\mathbb{H}$ of a group $\mathbb{G}$ is normal in $\mathbb{G}$ iff $\forall g \in G, g\mathbb{H}g^{-1} = \mathbb{H}$
:::

## Basic Properties of Homomorphisms

:::tip Proposition
Let $\phi: \mathbb{G_1} \rightarrow \mathbb{G_2}$ be a homomorphism of groups. Then

1. If e is the identity of $G_1$, then $\phi(e)$ is the identity of $\phi(G_2)$
2. For any element $g \in G_1, \phi(g^{-1}) = [\phi(g)]^{-1}$
3. If $\mathbb{H}_1$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{G}_1$, then $\phi(\mathbb{H}_1)$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{G}_2$
4. If $\mathbb{H}_2$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{G}_2$, then $\phi^{-1}(\mathbb{H}_2)$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{G}_1$. Furthermore, if $\mathbb{H}_2$ is normal in $\mathbb{G}_2$, then $\phi^{-1}(\mathbb{H}_2)$ is normal in $G_1$.
:::

## Kernel

### Definition

Let $\phi: \mathbb{G} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}$ be a group homomorphism and e is the identity of $\mathbb{H}$. By previous proposition, $\phi^{-1}(\{e\})$ is subgroup of G. This subgroup is called the kernel of $\phi$ and denoted by ker$\phi$.

### Proposition

Let $\phi: \mathbb{G} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}$ be a group homomorphism. Then the kernel of $\phi$ is a normal subgroup of $\mathbb{G}$.

# Quotient Groups

## Definition 

If $\mathbb{H}$ is a normal subgroup of a group $\mathbb{G}$, then the cosets of $\mathbb{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}$ form a group $\mathbb{G} / \mathbb{H}$ under the operation $(a \mathbb{H})(b \mathbb{H}) = ab\mathbb{H}$. This group is call the quotient group or factor group of $\mathbb{G}$ and $\mathbb{H}$.

:::important Theorem
If $\mathbb{H}$ is a normal subgroup of a group $\mathbb{G}$, then the cosets of $\mathbb{H}$ is $\mathbb{G}$ form a group $\mathbb{G} / \mathbb{H}$ of order $[\mathbb{G} : \mathbb{H}]$.
:::

:::important 良定义
所谓良定义的操作，就是要求操作独立于所参与操作的代表元。即对于某操作$\phi$, 如果$a = b$,则$\phi(a) = \phi(b)$, 对于商群而言这个操作是$a\mathbb{H} = b\mathbb{H}$
:::

# Isomorphism Theorem

## Canonical Homomorphism

Let $\mathbb{H}$ be a normal subgroup of $\mathbb{G}$, define a map

$$\phi: \mathbb{G} \rightarrow \mathbb{G}/\mathbb{H}$$

by

$$\phi(g) = g\mathbb{H}$$

This map is indeed a homomorphism. We call this map a natural or canonical homomorphism, and $ker\phi = \mathbb{H}$

:::important First Isomorphism Theorem
If $\psi: \mathbb{G} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}$ is a group homomorphism with $\mathbb{K} = ker\psi$, then $\mathbb{K}$ is normal in $\mathbb{G}$. Let $\phi: \mathbb{G} \rightarrow \mathbb{G}/\mathbb{K}$ be the canonical homomorphism. Then there exists a unique isomorphism $\eta: \mathbb{G}/\mathbb{K} \rightarrow \psi(\mathbb{G})$ such that $\psi = \eta\phi$
